GenerateInitConfig.cpp along with the header file, is a Monte-Carlo code for generating monodisperse,
bidisperse and polydisperse packings (normal and log-normal). 
The normal and log-normal generators are based on the pseudorandom number generator Mersenne Twister. 
Attached is an example image of a generated normal distribution with polydispersity 0.2.
